Adding contacts

In order to add a contact, fill in the "name", "address", "home" (This means home phone number), "mobile" and "notes" fields.
Please ensure that you have not included a , in any of the fields, and also ensure that you do not press "enter" at any time
while editing the notes section. The notes you have entered should be one long line, without any enter's.
Once you have checked that everything you have entered is correct, click the "submit" button. Do not click the submit button
twice, as this will add a duplicate of the currently viewed contact, which will have to be deleted (refer to the deleting
contacts section)


Viewing contacts

In order to view a contact, double-click on their name in the list on the right-hand side of the application window. 
Double-clicking anywhere in the list box without actually clicking on a name will bring up the information for the currently
selected (shown in a blue box) contact. 


Deleting/Editing contacts

In order to delete a contact, click on the "open" button, which will open the file browser. From there, right-click on the
file named "contacts.txt" and select "edit". If you delete a contact, make sure to remove the line they were on.
If you do not know how to do this, continue reading, as this section contains instructions on how to properly remove the line
.Do not leave an empty line at the end of the file - There should be no lines after the last contact in the list. If there 
are, click down into that line and Backspace until the line is deleted. This will be indicated by your text cursor 
(the blinking |) moving up to just after the last letter on the last line. To simply edit a contact, change the information
in the text file, but do not remove or add any , 's, and also do not press Enter at any point.
